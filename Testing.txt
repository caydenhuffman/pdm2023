Hello This is my text File that I'm using to learn how to use git/github.
This adds my second line of code. 
Also I need to figure out what this command means:
git push -u origin main
 - what does the "-u", "origin", and "main" mean? How are they connected?
 
 This is a line we added in our new branch <3
