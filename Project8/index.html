      Things We Must Complete: 
      (1) Compose Music to play along while painting.
          - must use Sequences, Scheduling, and <b>Looping</b> 
      <b>(2) Have interactions while painting generate corresponding sounds or music and make sure the 
          gestures and sounds are related. 
      (3) All user initiated events should have corresponding sound effects.</b>
      (4) Adapt the music/sounds effects with the drawing states (empty/filled screens)
       - we will do this and adjust some aspect of it based on "progress"
